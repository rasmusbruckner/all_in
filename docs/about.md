# About

I'm Rasmus Bruckner, a cognitive neuroscientist specializing in computational modeling of learning and decision-making. My research focuses on how humans adapt to uncertainty, integrating behavioral experiments with neuroimaging and computational approaches.

The `allinpy` package is increasingly used in our data analysis projects. 

Currently, I work at the [University of Hamburg](https://www.psy.uni-hamburg.de/en/arbeitsbereiche/kognitive-modellierung-und-neurowissenschaften-des-entscheidens.htmlScholar) and [Freie Universit√§t Berlin](https://www.ewi-psy.fu-berlin.de/en/psychologie/arbeitsbereiche/neural_dyn_of_vis_cog/learning-lab). I also serve as a PI in the DFG [Research Unit 5389](https://www.uni-hamburg.de/ru5389/research-unit.html), which investigates contextual influences on dynamic belief updating in volatile environments.
